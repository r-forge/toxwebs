\section{Introduction}

\R-package \tl, accompanying the paper \citep{Laender09} models the 
bioaccumulation of a nonbiotransforming chemical through a food web. 

It contains an implementation of the \code{OMEGA} model \citep{Hendriks01},
as extended for multiple food sources by \citep{Laender09}, and three
food web examples: the pelagic food web of the Barents Sea, and two food
webs of freshwater (lake) enclosures.

For background on inverse modelling, we refer to the documents of the 
\pkg{LIM} package \citep{LIM}, or the \pkg{limSolve} package \citep{limSolve}.

Also see \citep{xsample} for running a constrained monte carlo.

The \pkg{LIM} package also contains many other food web examples.

\section{The example food webs}
Three food webs are included in the package.

\subsection{LIMbarents}
The Barents Sea food web was published in \citep{LaenderMEPS} and the 
bioaccumulation model applied to it in \citep{LaenderEST}.

It consists of the linear inverse model specification for the Southern 
Barents Sea. 

The food web compartments for the area are dissolved organic carbon (DOC), 
detritus, bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates, 
phytoplankton (pico- and nanoplankton, diatoms and Phaeocystis sp.), 
mesozooplankton (copepods), macrozooplankton (krill and chaetognaths), 
cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and capelin (Mallotus villosus).
Adult cod (> 3 yrs) and young cod (< 3 yrs) were considered as two different 
populations.  

First the food web is solved:
<<label=Barents,include=FALSE>>=
plotweb(Flowmatrix(LIMbarents),main="Barents Sea Food Web",
  sub="gC/m2/day")
@

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.8\textwidth}

<<label=Barents,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
<<Barents>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{The Barents Sea food web}
\label{fig:b1}
\end{figure}

Then the ranges of flows and variables are calculated and plotted:

<<label=Barents2,include=FALSE>>=
pm <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
Plotranges(LIMbarents,lab.cex=0.7,xlab="gC/m2/d",
   main="Flows")
# 
Plotranges(LIMbarents,type="V",lab.cex=0.7,xlab="gC/m2/d",
   main="variables")
mtext(outer=TRUE,"Southern Barents Sea food web",side=3,line=-1,cex=1.5)
par(mfrow=pm)

<<Barents2>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{The Barents Sea food web ranges of flows and variables}
\label{fig:b2}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\subsection{LIMlake and LIMlakeFish}
This includes the Linear inverse model specification for two freshwater lake enclosures
  (Lac Croche, Canada), \citep{Ridal}, used as demonstration example in \citep{Laender09}.

  Food web compositions in the enclosures were manipulated by additions 
  of planktivorous fish and/or nutrients giving four types of food webs: 
  planktonic, planktonic with nutrient addition, planktonic with planktivorous 
  fish, and planktonic with planktivorous fish and nutrient additions. 
  The trophic links in the mass-balances of each LIM are identical, except 
  that the fish compartment is only present in F and FN. 
  
  \code{LIMlake} is the linear inverse model for the food web without fish 
  and without nutrient addition. 
  \code{LIMlakeFish} has fish, but also no nutrients were added.

First the food web is solved:
<<label=Limlake,include=FALSE>>=
pm <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
lake <- Flowmatrix(LIMlake)
plotweb(lake,main="Lake enclosure food web",sub="gC/m2/day")

plotweb(Flowmatrix(LIMlakeFish),main="Lake enclosure food web + FISH",
  sub="gC/m2/day")
@

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.8\textwidth}

<<label=Limlake,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
<<Limlake>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{The Limlake food web with and without fish}
\label{fig:l1}
\end{figure}

Then the ranges of flows and variables are calculated and plotted:

<<label=Limlake2,include=FALSE>>=
# ranges of flows
Plotranges(LIMlake,lab.cex=0.7,xlab="gC/m2/d",
   main="Flows")
# ranges of variables
Plotranges(LIMlake,type="V",lab.cex=0.7,xlab="gC/m2/d",
   main="variables")
mtext(outer=TRUE,"Lake enclosure food web",side=3,line=-1,cex=1.5)
par(mfrow=pm)
@

<<Limlake2>>

\section{The LimOmega function}

  The \code{OMEGA} model \citep{Hendriks01} estimates the rate of change 
  of the concentration Ci of a nonbiotransforming chemical in compartment i 
  by taking into account the chemical uptake rates through feeding and 
  directly from water, the chemical dilution rate through production and 
  the rates of egestion with faeces and excretion to water. 
  
  While \code{OMEGA} initially was developed to represent food chains, it 
  was extended with multiple food sources in \citep{Laender09}. 
  
  The set of differential equations for all m compartments in a food web was 
  cast in matrix notation as:
  
  \begin{eqnarray*}
   \frac{dC}{dt}=K_{up,food}\cdot C + K_{up,water}\cdot Cwater 
   - K_{out+dil} \cdot C
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $C$ is the internal concentration vector, $\frac{dC}{dt}$ is 
  the rate of change of the internal concentration vector, $K_{up,food}$ is 
  a m * m matrix with chemical uptake rates through feeding (d-1), containing 
  elements $k_{up,food,ji}$ on row i, column j, 
  $K_{up,water}$ the uptake rates directly from water ($L~kg^{-1}~ d^{-1}$) 
  is a column vector with m elements and $K_{out+dil}$ the chemical 
  dilution rate through production, the rates of egestion with faeces and 
  excretion to water ($d^{-1}$), a m * m diagonal matrix with elements 
  $k_{out,eg,i} + k_{dil,pr,i} + k_{out,water,i}$.

  Expressions for rate coefficients ($k_{up,food,ji}$; $k_{up,water,i}$; 
  $k_{out,eg,i}$; $k_{dil,pr,i}$; $k_{out,water,i}$) that regulate chemical 
  uptake and loss processes 
  and how these relate to the carbon flows predicted by the \pkg{LIM} framework can 
  be found in Table S1 of the Supporting Information (SI) of 
  \citep{Laender09}. 


  Internal concentrations in small particles such as microzooplankton, 
  phytoplankton, detritus, protozoa, and bacteria (collectively termed 
  \code{INST} in this package), are assumed to be in rapid equilibrium with 
  the water phase and may be calculated as 
   \begin{eqnarray*}
   C^*_{INST}= Cwater \cdot OC_{INST} \cdot K_{OC}
   \end{eqnarray*}
   
     
  where $C^*_{inst}$ denotes the concentration vector for model 
  compartments that are in instant equilibrium with the surrounding water
  (microg kg-1 wet weight), $OC_{inst}$ their organic carbon 
  fraction (-), and $K_{OC}$, the organic carbon-water 
  partition coefficient ($L~ kg^{-1}$), calculated as 0.41KOW, with KOW the octanol-water 
  partition coefficient.
\subsection{The bioaccumulation model applied to the three example food webs}  
First we apply the bioaccumulation model to the three food webs, and using 
the default values (e.g. a \code{logKoW} of 6):

The lake food web,
<<>>=
LimOmega (lim = LIMlake,
          INST=c("DET","DOC","BAC","PHY","NAN","CIL","MIZ"),
          KINE= "MEZ", EXPO=c("sed","gr"),
          DOC="DOC", DET="DET", DIC="dic",
          WW_KINE=7.596535e-08, SS_KINE=0.079508)
@
The lake food web with fish:
<<>>=
LimOmega (lim = LIMlakeFish,
          INST=c("DET","DOC","BAC","PHY","NAN","CIL","MIZ"),
          KINE=c("MEZ","FIS"), EXPO=c("sed","gr"),
          DOC="DOC", DET="DET", DIC="dic",
          WW_KINE=c(1.85e-08,1.7e-3),
          SS_KINE=c(0.00514800,0.26))
@
The Barents Sea example:
<<>>=
LimOmega (lim = LIMbarents,
          INST=c("DIA","PHA","AUT","CIL","HNA","DET","BAC"),
          KINE=c("COP","CHA","KRI","CAP","COD","YCO","HER"),
          EXPO=c("SED","GRA","GRO"),
          DOC="DOC", DET="DET", DIC="DIC",
          WW_KINE=c(0.000001,8e-05,0.00006,10e-3,3,1,20e-3),
          LIPID_KINE=c(0.01,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.03,0.03,0.03),
          LIPID_INST=0.04,
          SS_KINE=c(1.79,0.6965,0.003,0.38,0.053,0.006,0.055))
@
\subsection{A monte carlo run on food web structure}  

First we take \code{niter} random samples from all possible solutions using a
Markow Chain Monte Carlo approach \citep{xsample}
<<>>=
  X0       <- Lsei(LIMlake)$X
  niter <- 50
  SolXS    <- Xsample(LIMlake, iter=niter, type = "mirror",
                      jmp=NULL, x0=X0, fulloutput = FALSE)

  BAFlc_all  <- NULL
@
Then, for each of these samples the flowmatrix is created and LimOmega applied:
<<>>=
  for (i in 1:niter) {
   flowmat <- Flowmatrix(LIMlake, SolXS[i,])
   LO<- LimOmega (flowmatrix=flowmat,
          INST=c("DET","DOC","BAC","PHY","NAN","CIL","MIZ"),
          KINE=c("MEZ"), EXPO=c("sed","gr"),
          DOC="DOC", DET="DET", DIC="dic",
          WW_KINE=7.596535e-08, SS_KINE=0.079508,
          Growth=0, k=0.25, Q=1)

   BAFlc_all <- c(BAFlc_all,LO$BAF_LC)
  }
@
Show results
<<label=BAFlc_all,include=FALSE>>=
hist(BAFlc_all)
@

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.8\textwidth}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
<<label=BAFlc_all,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
<<BAFlc_all>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{The LimOmega model, applied 50 times, to the lake food web}
\label{fig:f1}
\end{figure}

Now the same food web structure is used with different chemical parameters:
<<>>=
  niter <- 100
@  
We create a normally distributed sample of log kow:
<<>>=
  lkw <- rnorm(niter,mean=6,sd=0.4)

  BAFlc_all  <- NULL
  BCFoc_all  <- NULL
@  
We also use the \code{LIMlake} foodweb:
<<>>=
  flowmat <- Flowmatrix(LIMlake)
@
and run the \code{LimOmega} model for each value of log kow:
<<>>=
  for (i in 1:niter) {
   LO<- LimOmega (flowmatrix=flowmat,
          INST=c("DET","DOC","BAC","PHY","NAN","CIL","MIZ"),
          KINE=c("MEZ"), EXPO=c("sed","gr"),
          DOC="DOC", DET="DET", DIC="dic",
          WW_KINE=7.596535e-08, SS_KINE=0.079508,
          Growth=0, k=0.25, Q=1, logKow = lkw[i])

   BAFlc_all <- c(BAFlc_all,LO$BAF_LC)
   BCFoc_all <- c(BCFoc_all,LO$BCF_OC[1])
  }
@
Finally, we plot the results:
<<label=BAFlc_2,include=FALSE>>=
pm <- par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(BAFlc_all,main="BAF_LC")
plot(lkw,BAFlc_all,xlab="log Kow",ylab="BAF_LC")
hist(BCFoc_all,main="BCF_OC")
plot(lkw,BCFoc_all,xlab="log Kow",ylab="BCF_OC")
par(mfrow=pm)
@

\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.8\textwidth}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
<<label=BAFlc_2,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=
<<BAFlc_2>>
@
\end{center}
\caption{The LimOmega model, applied with different values of log kow}
\label{fig:f2}
\end{figure}
